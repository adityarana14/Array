Must Do Questions On Array

EASY CATEGORY 

Q1) Given an unsorted array arr[] of size N, rotate it by D elements in the counter-clockwise direction. 

Q2) Given an array A of N elements. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A of size N is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array.

Q3) Given a non-negative number represented as a list of digits, add 1 to the number (increment the number represented by the digits). The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is first element of array.

Q4) Given an unsorted array Arr of N positive and negative numbers. Your task is to create an array of alternate positive and negative numbers without changing the relative order of positive and negative numbers. Note: Array should start with positive number.

Q5) Given an array A[] of size N, construct a Product Array P (of same size N) such that P[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of A except A[i].

Q6) You are given an array A of integers of length N. You need to calculate factorial of each number. The answer can be very large, so print it modulo 109 + 7.

Q7) Given an positive integer N and a list of N integers A[]. Each element in the array denotes the maximum length of jump you can cover. Find out if you can make it to the last index if you start at the first index of the list.
 
Q8) Given a binary array arr of size N and an integer M. Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's produced by flipping at most M 0's.

Q9)  Given an array arr[] of integers, find out the maximum difference between any two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number. 

Q10) Given an array A[] of N positive integers. The task is to find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of A[i] <= A[j].

Q11) Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size M and N respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that would be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.

Q12) Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 

Q13) Given an array Arr of N numbers and another number target, find three integers in the array such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers.

Q14) Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum.
